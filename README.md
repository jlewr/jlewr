## Hello! 👋
### 󠁧󠁢Helô, Halò, こんにちは、你好！👋

I'm a product manager.

- 🔭 I work at [**dxw**](https://github.com/dxw), helping public sector organisations to do good things for their users.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code apps in Swift, but I'm always interested in other things too.
- 💬 Ask me about product management or language learning.
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them, but anything is fine!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I grew up speaking English (C2), but I'm fluent in Mandarin Chinese (C1?) and pretty good at Japanese (B1), Scottish Gaelic (B1) and Welsh (A2) too.
